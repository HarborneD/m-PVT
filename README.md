# m-PVT
A mobile ready implementation of a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) test. 

This implementation is part of the paper:
Evans, M. S., Harborne, D., & Smith, A. P. (in preparation). Measuring fatigue using a modified mobile version of the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (m-PVT).

It offers a PVT test that can be taken within a browser on most devices. It's aim is to show proof of concept for a system that could help reduce the number of drivers operating public transport while under high levels of fatigue.
